# Closing the gap in the clinical adoption of computational pathology: a standardized, open-source framework to integrate deep-learning algorithms into the laboratory information system
Framework based on HL7 messaging and freely available digital pathology (DP) resources to integrate deep-learning models into the anatomic pathology laboratory information system (AP-LIS)

> [!CAUTION]
> All software (except for the AP-LIS) and DL models employed in this work are non-commercial, open-source resources intended for research use only. Hence, use of the integration workflow outside of research context is under the responsibility of the user.
