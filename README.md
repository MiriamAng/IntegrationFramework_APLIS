# Closing the gap in the clinical adoption of computational pathology: a standardized, open-source framework to integrate deep-learning algorithms into the laboratory information system
Framework based on HL7 messaging and freely available digital pathology (DP) resources to integrate deep-learning models into the anatomic pathology laboratory information system (AP-LIS)

> [!CAUTION]
> All software (except for the AP-LIS) and DL models employed in this work are non-commercial, open-source resources intended for research use only. Hence, use of the integration workflow outside of research context is under the responsibility of the user.

> [!TIP]
> 1. Once you download the code, please make sure to replace in the main.py script the variables storing the IP addresses as server (*hs*) and clienti (*hc*) with the corrisponding ports (*ps* and *pc*)
> 2. The developed framework was tested using AMD GPUs, but if you have NVIDIA GPUs please install pytorch accordingly
